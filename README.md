# Color Me Surprised

A small discord bot project intended for small servers where users can pick their own color using this bot!

Yeah, I know, this is still code that's ugly as hecc, but heck u, I made dis in like two hours

## Setup
- If you haven't already, install node.js on the machine you want this to run on. Get it here: https://nodejs.org/en/
- Clone this repository.
- Run `npm install` in the cloned directory. This will fetch discord.js
- Create a Discord Bot user on the official Discord Developers website.
- To add the bot to your Discord server, modify the link below to match your bot ID. The permissions flag will automatically create a role that has "Manage Roles" enabled.
- Put your bot user token and nothing else in a new file called 'token.txt' in the root directory of the cloned bot.
- Start the bot with `node run.js`.
